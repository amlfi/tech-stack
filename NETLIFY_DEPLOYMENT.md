# Netlify Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through deploying your Tech Stack website to Netlify with Decap CMS integration.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with the `tech-stack` repository
- The repository should be public (or have a paid Netlify plan for private repos)

## Step 1: Create Netlify Account

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Sign Up" in the top right
3. Choose "Sign up with GitHub" for easiest integration
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account

## Step 2: Deploy Your Site

### Option A: Import from GitHub (Recommended)

1. Once logged into Netlify, click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
2. Choose "GitHub" as your Git provider
3. Search for and select your `tech-stack` repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: `BUILD_DIR=dist npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - Click "Show advanced" and add environment variable:
     - Key: `BUILD_DIR`
     - Value: `dist`
5. Click "Deploy site"

Netlify will now:
- Clone your repository
- Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- Run your build command
- Deploy the `dist` folder to their CDN

### Option B: Netlify CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/moana/Dropbox\ (Personal)/DEV/txstack

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Initialize and deploy
netlify init

# Follow the prompts:
# - Create & configure a new site
# - Connect to GitHub repo
# - Build command: BUILD_DIR=dist npm run build
# - Publish directory: dist

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

## Step 3: Set Up GitHub OAuth Authentication

**Note**: Netlify Identity is deprecated. We'll use GitHub OAuth instead (simpler and more reliable).

### Create GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Click **"New OAuth App"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Application name**: Tech Stack CMS
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app` (use your actual Netlify URL)
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`
4. Click **"Register application"**
5. Copy your **Client ID**
6. Click **"Generate a new client secret"** and copy it

### Add OAuth to Netlify

1. In Netlify dashboard: **Site settings** â†’ **Access control** â†’ **OAuth**
2. Click **"Install provider"** â†’ **"GitHub"**
3. Enter:
   - **Client ID**: (from GitHub)
   - **Client Secret**: (from GitHub)
4. Click **"Install"**

**ðŸ“– Detailed OAuth Guide**: See [GITHUB_OAUTH_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_OAUTH_SETUP.md)

## Step 4: Access Your CMS

Once deployed and OAuth is configured:

1. Visit `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin/`
2. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
3. Authorize the OAuth app when prompted
4. You should see the Decap CMS interface with:
   - **Tools** collection (to manage your tools)
   - **Categories** collection (to manage categories)
   - **Site Configuration** (to update site settings)

## Step 5: Update Your Repository Settings (Optional)

If you want to customize your Netlify domain:

1. Go to "Site settings" â†’ "Domain management"
2. Click "Options" next to your netlify.app domain
3. Choose "Edit site name"
4. Enter a custom subdomain (e.g., `my-tech-stack.netlify.app`)

## Editing Content

### Through the CMS (Recommended)

1. Go to `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin/`
2. Click "Tools" â†’ "New Tool"
3. Fill in the form (name, description, category, icon, etc.)
4. Click "Save" â†’ "Publish"
5. Decap CMS will create a commit to your GitHub repo
6. Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your site

### Through GitHub (Advanced)

You can still edit JSON files directly in the `data/tools/` folder on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to `data/tools/`
3. Click "Add file" â†’ "Create new file"
4. Name it `tool-name.json`
5. Add JSON content following the schema
6. Commit the file
7. Netlify will auto-deploy

## Editorial Workflow (Optional)

The CMS is configured with an editorial workflow that allows:

- **Drafts**: Save work without publishing
- **Review**: Submit for review
- **Publish**: Deploy to production

To use this:

1. In the CMS, create or edit content
2. Instead of "Publish now", choose "Save as draft"
3. Your changes are saved in a Pull Request on GitHub
4. Review the PR, and when ready, merge it
5. Netlify auto-deploys the merged changes

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Netlify

Check the deploy log in Netlify. Common issues:

- Missing dependencies: Make sure `package.json` includes all dependencies
- Node version: We're using Node 18, specified in `netlify.toml`
- Build command: Should be `BUILD_DIR=dist npm run build`

### Can't Log Into CMS

- Make sure GitHub OAuth is configured in Netlify (Site settings â†’ Access control â†’ OAuth)
- Verify Client ID and Secret are correct
- Check callback URL is exactly: `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done`
- Make sure your GitHub account has write access to the repo
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies

### Changes Not Appearing

- Check the deploy log - did the build succeed?
- Hard refresh your browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Check if you're in editorial workflow mode (changes might be in a draft PR)

## Next Steps

Once deployed, you can:

1. **Add a custom domain**: Configure DNS to point to Netlify
2. **Enable HTTPS**: Netlify provides free SSL certificates
3. **Set up form handling**: Netlify Forms for contact forms
4. **Configure redirects**: Edit `netlify.toml` for URL redirects
5. **Add analytics**: Netlify Analytics or Google Analytics
