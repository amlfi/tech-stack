> Blockquote
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Tool Descriptions

- Keep under 160 characters for clean display
- Focus on what it does, not why (use Content field for "why")
- Be concise but informative

### Subcategories

Use subcategories to group similar tools:
- Development: "Code Editor", "Terminal", "Version Control"
- Design: "UI Design", "Prototyping", "Graphics"
- Productivity: "Note Taking", "Task Management", "Communication"

### Tags

Add 3-5 relevant tags per tool for better search:
- Company/creator name
- Technology/language
- Use case
- Platform (if specific)

### Featured Tools

- Mark 3-8 tools as featured (your favorites)
- Featured tools stand out visually
- Don't over-use it (defeats the purpose)

### Content Quality

For the "Why I Use It" section:
- Explain your specific use case
- Mention key features you rely on
- Compare to alternatives if relevant
- Keep it personal and authentic

## Workflow Examples

### Adding a New Development Tool

1. Access CMS â†’ Tools â†’ New Tool
2. Fill in:
   ```
   Name: Cursor
   Description: AI-powered code editor built on VSCode
   Category: development
   Subcategory: Code Editor
   URL: https://cursor.sh
   Tags: ["ai", "editor", "copilot", "vscode"]
   Status: active
   Featured: true
   Content: |
     I switched to Cursor for its native AI integration. The inline suggestions
     and chat interface make refactoring and learning new codebases much faster.

     Unlike GitHub Copilot, it understands the full context of my project and
     can suggest changes across multiple files.
   ```
3. Upload icon/logo
4. Save â†’ Publish now
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
6. Refresh your site to see the new tool

### Retiring an Old Tool

1. Find the tool (e.g., "Atom Editor")
2. Edit it:
   ```
   Status: retired
   Replaced By: Visual Studio Code
   Notes: |
     Atom was great but GitHub archived it in 2022.
     VSCode has better performance and extension ecosystem.
   ```
3. Publish
4. Tool moves to "Previously Used" section

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot publish" error

- Check if you're online
- Make sure you're logged in (session might have expired)
- Try saving as draft first, then publishing

### Image won't upload

- Check file size (under 5MB)
- Use supported formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF)
- Try renaming the file (remove special characters)

### Changes not appearing on site

- Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to rebuild
- Check deploy status in Netlify dashboard
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Lost changes

- Check the "Workflow" view for drafts
- Check GitHub for uncommitted PRs
- CMS auto-saves drafts every few seconds

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Cmd/Ctrl + S**: Save draft
- **Cmd/Ctrl + P**: Publish
- **Cmd/Ctrl + E**: Edit mode
- **Esc**: Close dialogs

---

Happy editing! Your changes will be live within 1-2 minutes of publishing. ðŸš€
