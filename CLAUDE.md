# txstack

> Personal tech stack showcase — a static site cataloging every tool, app, and service used for development and productivity.

**Stack**: Handlebars + custom Node.js build + TinaCMS (Tina Cloud) + Netlify
**Author**: Anthony (Moana)

---

## Project Overview

txstack is a single-page static site that displays 47+ tools across 8 categories (System & Utilities, Development, Productivity, Communication, Creative & Media, Security, Specialized Tools, AI & Automation). Each tool is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter. A custom `build.js` script reads the markdown, compiles Handlebars templates, and outputs static HTML to `public/`.

**CMS**: TinaCMS via Tina Cloud — visual editing at app.tina.io. Replaced Decap CMS entirely.
**Hosting**: Netlify (primary), GitHub Pages (alt).

## Project Structure

```
content/tools/*.md        → Tool entries (name, category, status, icon, etc.)
content/categories.json   → 8 categories with icons and subcategories
content/settings.json     → Site title, author, theme preference
templates/index.hbs       → Main page layout (Handlebars)
templates/partials/       → Reusable components (tool-card.hbs)
src/styles/               → main.css (layout) + themes.css (color schemes)
src/scripts/              → theme.js, search.js, filter.js, modal.js
tina/                     → TinaCMS config (Tina Cloud mode)
tina/__generated__/       → Auto-generated by tinacms build (DO NOT edit manually)
build.js                  → Custom static site generator
dev-server.js             → Express + Chokidar dev server (port 3000)
public/                   → Build output (deployed to Netlify)
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Local development (bypasses TinaCMS native module issue)
node build.js && node dev-server.js

# Full dev with TinaCMS admin (only works outside Dropbox path)
npm run dev

# Production build (used by Netlify)
npm run build    # → tinacms build && node build.js

# Initialize sample content
npm run init-content
```

---

## Known Constraints

### Dropbox path breaks native modules
This project lives at `~/Dropbox (Personal)/DEV/txstack`. The parentheses in the path cause `better-sqlite3` (a TinaCMS dependency) to fail during native module compilation. **Workaround**: Run `node build.js && node dev-server.js` directly for local dev, skipping `tinacms dev`. Or use a symlink from outside Dropbox to run `tinacms dev` when you need to regenerate `tina-lock.json`.

### TinaCMS lock file
`tina-lock.json` is the schema contract with Tina Cloud. Only `tinacms dev` regenerates it — `tinacms build` does NOT. If you change `tina/config.ts`, you must run `tinacms dev` to regenerate the lock file before pushing.

### Netlify secrets scanner
`tinacms build` embeds `TINA_TOKEN` into generated client code. This is by design (read-only content token), but Netlify's scanner flags it. May need to dismiss in Netlify dashboard.

### Build uses `--skip-cloud-checks`
Added to `netlify.toml` to bypass stale Tina Cloud schema validation. CMS still works at runtime.

## Key Configuration

| Item | Location |
|------|----------|
| TinaCMS config | `tina/config.ts` |
| Netlify config | `netlify.toml` |
| Site settings | `content/settings.json` |
| Categories | `content/categories.json` |
| Git remote | SSH (`git@github.com`) |
| Env vars (Netlify) | `TINA_CLIENT_ID`, `TINA_TOKEN` |

---

## Coding Standards

- **Vanilla JS** — no frameworks. Search, filter, modal, and theme are hand-written ES6
- **No TypeScript** in runtime code (TinaCMS config is the exception)
- **Handlebars** for templating — logic-less, partials-based
- **CSS custom properties** for theming (light/dark/auto)
- **CommonJS** in build scripts (`require`), ES6 in browser scripts

---

## Content Schema (Tool Frontmatter)

Each tool markdown file in `content/tools/` has these fields:

```yaml
name: "Tool Name"
category: "development"          # One of 8 categories
subcategory: "IDE"               # Free-text subcategory
icon: "tool-icon.png"            # Icon filename
url: "https://example.com"       # Tool website
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]           # Searchable tags
status: "active"                 # active | retired
featured: true                   # Show in featured section
devices: ["mac", "iphone"]      # Device availability
display: true                    # Show on site
previouslyUsed: false            # Moved to "Previously Used" section
replacedBy: ""                   # If retired, what replaced it
notes: "Usage notes"             # Personal notes (textarea)
```

## 🔴 Session Tracking (_WORKING.md)

**AI AGENTS: You MUST maintain `_WORKING.md` in the project root.**

### At the START of every session:
1. Read `_WORKING.md` to understand previous work, decisions, and open TODOs
2. Note the current status and any unresolved issues

### At the END of every session:
1. Add a new session entry to the **Session Log** section at the bottom
2. Update the **Current Status** section if anything changed
3. Update the **TODO** section — check off completed items, add new ones

### Session Entry Format

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — Session N: Brief Title

**Summary**: 1-2 sentences describing what was accomplished.

**Challenges & Solutions**:
- **Problem description** — what went wrong or was difficult
  - **Solution**: How it was resolved

**Key Decisions**:
- Decision made and why

**Learnings**:
- Something discovered that's useful for future sessions
```

### What to Track
- What was accomplished (be specific — file names, commands run)
- Problems encountered and how they were solved
- Decisions made and the reasoning
- Anything learned that would help in the next session
- Files modified

### What NOT to Track
- Generic descriptions ("worked on the project")
- AI conversation meta-commentary
- Permission prompts or tool mechanics

### Top-Level Sections to Maintain

The `_WORKING.md` has these persistent sections that should be updated as things change:

| Section | Update When |
|---------|-------------|
| **Challenges & Solutions** | New issues discovered or resolved |
| **Key Decisions** | Architecture or approach decisions made |
| **Learnings** | New insights worth preserving |
| **Current Status** | Project state changes |
| **TODO** | Items completed or new items identified |
| **Session Log** | Every session (append new entries at bottom) |

---

## Security

- **Never commit `.env` files** — secrets managed via 1Password/environment
- **Never commit `tina/__generated__/client.ts` with real tokens** — `tinacms build` regenerates it
- Netlify env vars: `TINA_CLIENT_ID`, `TINA_TOKEN` (set in dashboard, not code)

*This project is part of Anthony's personal development ecosystem. Session continuity is maintained through `_WORKING.md`.*
